<p>This is the fun step, where you get to alter the site to meet you needs, organize the information structure, and select visual display preferences.</p>

<p>Up until now, the site has been maintained and view locally. This means that even if you gave someone the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code>, they will not see the content youâ€™ve created.  So now itâ€™s time to make the Jekyll site viewable publically (if thatâ€™s what you choose). This is also where I hit a snag.</p>
