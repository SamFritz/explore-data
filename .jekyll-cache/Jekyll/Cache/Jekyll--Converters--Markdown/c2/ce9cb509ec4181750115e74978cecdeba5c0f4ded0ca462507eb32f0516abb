<p>My interest in working with a Jekyll site came after attending a few workshops, where instructions had been set up through an insitutional repository and displays through the just-the-docs theme.</p>

<p>I wanted to launch a Jekyll site that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>brought together materials walking through my data analysis exploration (of which there are a variety of techniques)</li>
  <li>it’s a humbling experience to do something difficult and out of your comfort zone, when there’s an easier option</li>
</ul>
