<p>Some fun facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m not a coder,</li>
  <li>most of my coding â€œexpertiseâ€ is a combination of frantically Googling errors and trying not to throw my laptop, and</li>
  <li>I am a believer of what doesnâ€™t kill you makes you strongerâ€¦.especially when youâ€™ve made it to the otherside.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that in mind, this section focuses on how I got my first Jekyll site up and running.</p>
