## Resources

The following resources were very helpful as I launched my first Jekyll site! 

* Building Initial Jekyll site with [Mike Dane YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1na-IWfv08M&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=8)
* Building Project Websites with Jekyll and GitHub Pages with [UBC](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-project-sites/)
* Changing the theme to [Just-the-Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)

Some other reference resources that provide a basic and general knowledge of Jekyll include:

* Basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Source code for [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) at GitHub
