### 5. Customize and Create

This is the fun step, where you get to alter the site to meet you needs, organize the information structure, and select visual display preferences.



### 6. Publish

Up until now, the site has been maintained and view locally. This means that even if you gave someone the `http://localhost:4000`, they will not see the content you've created.  So now it's time to make the Jekyll site viewable publically (if that's what you choose). This is also where I hit a snag.
