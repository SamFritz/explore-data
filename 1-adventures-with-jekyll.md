# Introduction

Some fun facts:
* I'm not a coder, 
* most of my coding "expertise" is a combination of frantically Googling errors and trying not to throw my laptop, and 
* I am a believer of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger....especially when you've made it to the otherside.

With all that in mind, this section focuses on how I got my first Jekyll site up and running.
